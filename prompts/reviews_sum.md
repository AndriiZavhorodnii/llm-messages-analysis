I have list of reviews about Category â€” Pricing, Subscription & Billing Issues (they are in csv file)

find Patterns, themes, and pain points in all of these reviews, and generate product hypothesis that  are Specific, testable, and product-relevant hypotheses that will help me to improve my app

these are reviews on the app Headway(app with short summaries for books mostly to learn valuable information faster), and we want to improve it an need to generate product hypothesis, so that is the main task
VERY IMPORTANT: **don't use a sample of data, check the whole dataset = all reviews**
!!!!!VERY VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE CODE TO ANALYZE REVIEWS!!!!!!
